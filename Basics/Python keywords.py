# as ---> Used in aliasing

# Assert
# It is always followed by a condition.
# If the condition is true, nothing will happen.
# If the condition is false, (AssertionError) is raised

# async....await

import asyncio

# DEL --> It is used to delete the reference to an object

# RAISE
# This code equals to:

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FINALLY
# It is used to ensure that a specific statement will be executed even if there is a caught exception.

# Global
# It is used to declare a variable inside a function as a local variable.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LAMBDA(Inline function)

# Yield
# Similar to (return), but it returns generator
'''
Generator is an iterator that generates one item at a time. 
A large list of values will take up a lot of memory. 
Generators are useful in this situation 
as it generates only one value at a time instead of 
storing all the values in memory.
'''

# Example
def generator():
    for i in range(6):
        yield i * i

g = generator()
for i in g:
    print(i)
# Output:
'''
0
1
